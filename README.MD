#  JavaScript Practical Week Project

##  Overview
This project was developed as part of my **JavaScript Practical Week**.  
It demonstrates how to build a **fully functional dynamic website** using **pure JavaScript**, with **client-side data storage**, **user authentication**, and **session protection** — all without a backend server.

The project showcases modern front-end logic such as:
- Dynamic UI rendering
- Local storage database simulation
- Hashed password authentication
- Navigation and page management
- Protected user sessions
- Responsive and interactive interface

---

##  Features

###  Authentication System
- **Signup**: Users can create an account with their name, email, and password.  
- **Password Hashing**: All passwords are **hashed** before saving to LocalStorage for basic security.
- **Login**: Validates credentials by comparing hashed passwords.
- **Session Management**: Logged-in users remain authenticated until they log out.

###  Local Storage Database
- Acts as the **main data store**.
- Stores user information and session data.
- Automatically initializes on first use.

###  Navigation Management
- Dynamic navigation bar that changes based on login status.
- Prevents unauthorized access to protected pages (e.g., Dashboard).
- Session checks on every page load.

###  Dynamic Website
- Pages and components are **generated dynamically** using JavaScript DOM manipulation.
- Fully responsive layout with modular design.
